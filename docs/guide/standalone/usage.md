# Usage

First, make sure Cap Standalone is installed and running by following [the installation guide](installation.md).

Then, you can get to using Cap Standalone:

### Client-side

Let's configure your widget to use your self-hosted Cap Standalone server. To do this, set the widget's API endpoint option to:

```
https://<instance_url>/<site_key>/
```

Make sure to replace:

- `<instance_url>`: The actual URL where your Cap Standalone instance is running. This URL must be publicly accessible from the internet.
- `<site_key>`: Your site key from this dashboard.

Example:

```html
<cap-widget
  data-cap-api-endpoint="https://cap.example.com/d9256640cb53/"
></cap-widget>
```

### Server-side

After a user completes the CAPTCHA on your site, your backend needs to verify their token using this server's API.

You can do this by sending a `POST` request from your server to the following endpoint:

```
https://<instance_url>/<site_key>/siteverify
```

Your request needs to include the following data:

- `secret`: Your key secret from this dashboard. This is **not** the admin key, but rather your site key's secret.

- `response`: The CAPTCHA token generated by the widget on the client-side

Example using `curl`:

```bash
curl "https://<instance_url>/<site_key>/siteverify" \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "secret": "<key_secret>", "response": "<captcha_token>" }'
```

The response should look like this:

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

Or, if the captcha token is invalid or expired, it will return:

```json
{
  "success": false
}
```

If `success` is true, you can proceed with your app logic.
