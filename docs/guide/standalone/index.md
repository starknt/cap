# Cap Standalone

Cap Standalone is a self-hosted version of Cap's backend that allows you to spin up a server to validate and create challenges so you can use it with languages other than JS.

It's simple yet amazingly powerful, allowing you to use Cap in any language that can make HTTP requests. It's mostly compatible with reCAPTCHA and hCaptcha's siteverify enpoints, so you can use it as a drop-in replacement for them.

It also offers API key support, a built-in assets server, a dashboard with statistics, and more. To get started, follow [the instructions to install it on your server](installation.md).
